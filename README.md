# Frontend - Next.js Application  

This project is the frontend of the application, built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and bootstrapped using [create-next-app](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). To get started, clone the repository and move into the frontend folder, then install dependencies using `npm install` (or `yarn install`, `pnpm install`, or `bun install`). Once installation is complete, you can run the development server with `npm run dev` (or the respective command for your package manager), and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result. The main entry point for editing is `app/page.js`, and the page will automatically update as you make changes thanks to hot reloading. This project also uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a modern font family from Vercel. For learning and exploring more about Next.js, you can check out the [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) to explore features and API, or follow the [Interactive Tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn) to practice step by step. Contributions and feedback are always welcome on the [Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js). When you are ready to deploy, the easiest way is to use [Vercel](https://vercel.com), the platform created by the makers of Next.js, which provides seamless deployment and optimizations. More details can be found in the [deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying).  

âœ¨ Built with **Next.js** for a fast, modern, and optimized frontend.
